The Challenge- Predict Natural Disasters
We can use data analysis to predict natural disasters.
We can use various factors like:-
a)geographic condition of a place.
b)climate conditions.
c)wind speed
d)direction of wind  and many more....
We can also use Big Data because it can play it's role in following ways:-
a)determining risk to humans
b)monitoring hazards
c)analysing the history of a particular place to predict the future
so in these ways by using data analysis and using libraries of python such as numpy and panda we can successfully predict natural disasters.
Thank You!
